WHY ME!!!???
Pretty sad I was!!! The circumstances I was going through…the things that were happening to me…I was shattered in each and every way possible…good friends leaving me…closed ones hurting me…academic performance getting poor… and seeing others happy in their lives made me feel even worse…was totally confused,could not get the roads to put myself on right track…seemed like did not had colours to paint my life..similar to like I had no clothes having happy colour..people used to console me..some used to say dude you should have tackled the thing the other way round but I always used to say to them..its easy to second guess an operation from an arm chair..Every time when something bad used to happen to me the only question that used to keep banging my head was WHY ME!!!??? Bad and sad things went on continuing in my life like some medical exam’s portion/syllabus..I mean unending…these things used to make me think whether GOD exists..but somewhere deep down the line, my heart knew that there is some ultimate thing who controls all such stuff..I did not loose hope.. One day I made up my mind to throw this question to GOD.. Was waiting for the next dawn..So the very next morning when the sun painted everything with the gold…just like everyday I started praying to GOD but before ending my prayers I asked GOD the same…I did not get any answer…I tried next day again…still did not get answer…I kept on asking daily…one day when I was driving my way to the daily routine saw a heart throbbing accident of a guy and his mother…their souls left the heaven earth the immediate moment…that time my inner soul did not ask GOD WHY ME SAFE...reached the station…saw a guy with only a leg and a hand crying his stomach out fr food…even that time I did not think of WHY ME with the facilities of studying in A grade college..with all the amenities at my home..with a properly functioning body… With the time passing I got my good friends back..the closed ones made me happy much more than the way they had hurt…academic performance got good…even that time I did not ask GOD WHY ME for all this happiness.. And there it was..The big bro in the sky had answered my prayers.. The thing is we never thank GOD fr whatever good happens to us…all we do is complain..complain..and only complain.. to realize the importance of water you need to be thirsty for sometime what I mean is the importance of good times and happiness is understood only when we don’t have them..whenever we go through any hard times in our lives..all we need to tell ourselves is..”the night is just darker before the dawn”..
